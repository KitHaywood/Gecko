AIM

The aim of this project is to create a standalone automated systematic trading algorithm and execution engine which will:

STAGE 1

1) Use json historic priciung data of a growing number of cryptocurrencies as a base for backtesting
2) Continuously update the json data with the latest figure with a maximum latency of 1min
3) Perform optimisation analysis of the best curve fits for each crypto, which define maxima and minima, and then store these results continuously for analysis day on day.
4) Correlate the fitted curve with EMA/SMA backtested profiles and store results for subsequent analysis
5) Define its own strategies for specific cryptos or combinations thereon and backtest to validate
6) Analyse the movement in crypto prices wrt to the fitted curve, EMA/SMA Cross backtests and where both signal pending price action - send market orders an exchange and buy/sell.
7) Watch the open positions and exit when the momentum fades.

STAGE 2 

1) Write Twitter Developer api link to retrieve data on people of importance to each crypto, and store results. 
2) Integrate the results of NLP on these people into the momentum cross model and correlate tweet content/viewership/comment content with price action.
